Sending email with python through gmail.

Previously configure the gmail account with second authentication factor.

This will be the password that you must enter to log in to your account.

The libraries used in this script are included in python, so you won't have to install anything.

It should be noted that this script is designed only to use a gmail account for the sender, however it can be used to send to any email account.
